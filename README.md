## Business Objective

Our clients are Uber and Lyft cab services. Uber is a global transportation giant operating in numerous countries, while Lyft focuses on the US market. Both offer various cab services, with Uber having a market share of 61% and Lyft at 31%. Lyft operates only in the USA and Canada.

## Data Processing

### Null Value Treatment:
Handling null values is critical for data preprocessing. In this dataset, null values in the 'price' column were eliminated by removing corresponding rows.

### Skew Correctness:
Skewness correction involves adjusting data distribution to make it more symmetric. Transformations were applied to reduce skewness in the 'price' and 'distance' columns.
